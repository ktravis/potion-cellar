 ask yourself:
 - does this contribute to making this more playable (closer to game/fun?)

 p o t i o n  c e l l a r
 ------------------------

- "taking the plunge"
- magic but the magic is generally either pretty mundane (floating things, an enchanted lighter that doesn't use fuel, a
  book with changing pages) or mind-breaking (eternal curses, multiversal destruction, uknowable shapes/topologies, ...)
- no traditional combat
- there is crazy stuff going on but most people are just trying to get by
- people come from above to get resources or just generally cause problems, unclear why ("uplanders"?)
- the people above leave old tech around
- bartering
- "hp": "pips" of consciousness/awareness/sanity
  - food, intellectual stimulation contribute as resources
- potions provide different benefits (some temporary, some permanent), but also cause toxicity, accumulating more
 toxicity can increase tolerance, reducing negative side effects
- difficult concepts / toxic ideas as "traps" in the level
- bullies (enemies) try to take things from you, options:
  - reason (friendly words)
  - bribe
  - challenge (with aggressive ideas/words)
  - flee
- stats:
  - rational thought / reasoning
  - calculus
  - mysticism/gnosis
  - determinism
  - coping/handling
- gotta go down to go up
- very limited inventory/carrying capacity encourages trade-offs, using items
- boxes in levels to store excess items that persist between "dives"
- return to surface to engage in COMMERCE sell/trade
  - prices and item availability set by global conditions/events (weather, etc)
  - can only sell or trade based upon demand?
- allegiance/rejection of the demiurge
- obtain different trinkets/decorations for your bag that convey different benefits
- relationship bonds with different characters in and out of your trip
  - maybe some are just for one time through, some are "global"

visual
------
- (lightweight?) serif fonts
- animal-based humanoid characters
- billboard sprites
- point lights with step function (not gradient)
- dithered shading
- heavy color grading
- talking heads for npc conversations
- render low res and upscale with no AA

inspiration
-----------

- "The Hole" from Dorohedoro (magical, grunge, some technology)
- Undertale monster world
- Tower of Babylon story (toroidal world, mining through to the other side)
